Snake Game in C++
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using C++ programming language. The game is played on the console where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries or with its own body.

Prerequisites
To run this game, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

How to Run
Clone the repository or download the source code files.

Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Compile the source code using the C++ compiler. For example, using g++:
The game will start in the console window.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.
The objective is to eat the food represented by a symbol (e.g., @) to score points and grow longer.
Avoid colliding with the boundaries or with the snake's own body, as it will end the game.
The score will be displayed on the screen, indicating the number of food items eaten.
